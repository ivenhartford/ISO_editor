#include "Constants.h"

// Implementation file for Constants
// Most constants are defined as constexpr in the header,
// but this file is included for future expansion and to ensure
// the constants namespace is properly instantiated during linking.

namespace Constants {
    // If we need any runtime-initialized constants, they go here
    // For now, this file is intentionally minimal
}
