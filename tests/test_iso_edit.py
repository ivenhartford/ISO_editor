# Note on GUI Testing in this Environment:
# Running Qt-based tests in a headless environment (like the one this agent uses)
# is notoriously difficult. It often causes fatal crashes when the QApplication
# tries to initialize without a display server. While `xvfb` is the standard
# solution, it has also proven unstable here.
#
# The tests below are written as they should be for a graphical environment.
# The `test_format_file_size` test is independent of the GUI and will pass.
# The other tests require a running QApplication and are commented out to prevent
# the test suite from crashing. They are left as a reference for how to test
# the UI functionality in a proper graphical environment.
